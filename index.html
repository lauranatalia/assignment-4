			<p>Everyone needs a sense of community in order to feel at home in their 		
			neighbourhood.</p>
			<p>It is always nice to call someone who lives close to you if you need help, 			or simply if you want to enjoy a beautiful day outside or do an activity. 					
			Reaching out to the people around you for companionship will make your 			
			community experience more exiting.</p>
			<p>with over 15 years of experience, we have come up with the perfect 		
			approach for you to meet people near you with the same interests.</p>
			<p>There are many ways for you to become engaged with your communities and 		
			make new friends. You don't have to stay within your house — in fact, it's 
			often a good idea to make friends outside your discipline to get new 	
			perspectives.</p>
